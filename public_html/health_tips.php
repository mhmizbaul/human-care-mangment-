 				<p>Almost half of the blood that you donate is made up of water. The fluids that you lose during donation can cause a drop in blood pressure – causing you to feel faint and dizzy.

 					To help prevent this from happening we ask you to drink 500ml of water immediately before you give blood - we’ll give this to you before you donate. Please help us reduce our plastic usage by bringing your own refillable bottle.

 					It’s also important to ensure that you are well hydrated in the days leading up to your donation. This will help to compensate for the fluids lost during donation, and will help to bring your blood volume levels back to normal.
 				It is essential to avoid alcohol before and after donating as this may affect hydration levels and delay recovery.</p>
